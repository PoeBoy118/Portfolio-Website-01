# Portfolio-Website-01
First Portfolio Website made from scratch
This was the first portfolio website I made through the Nucamp Web Development Fundamentals bootcamp.  I took my skills of structuring a webpage with HTML, styling the page with CSS, and adding mobile-ready componets to the page using Bootstrap 5.

This was my first attempt at making something like this, so I admit it's still al little rough around the edges.  I wasn't sure what kind of content to add to the page initially and didn't really have to much time to add things closer to the end of the course.

I would probably try to find some way to flesh out the individual sections I have and make them their own pages rather than keep them as small parts of the main page.  I'm not sure what else I would do with the contact info in the footer; maybe I should take the contact info out of the footer and place it somewhere else, leaving more navigation links down there along with some other info.  I might also consider using a template first now that I generally understand how the individual parts work on a webpage compared to before.

All things considered I'm happy with how it came out as everything functions the way I want it to, but I lacks some polish.  I think I will try to expand on the info in the page and add more pages to the site, but I want to go over some templates beforehand.  I dont think there is a reason to scrap the whole website but I don't know how well this will be received in a professional setting in it's current state.
