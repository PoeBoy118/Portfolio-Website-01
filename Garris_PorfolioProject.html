      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I was born in Buffalo, New York</li>
        <li>I'm still currently living here in Buffalo</li>
        <li>
          The ideal dream job for me would be doing something in game
          development, though I don't think I would mind too much other than
          preproduction work. As long as I get a good salary and management
          isn't too bad I think I could do it.
        </li>
        <li>
          One goal I'd like to accomplish in my lifetime would be to do
          breakdancing windmills. I've seen a number of people do them in
          videos, but I wanna do some myself and show off a little.
        </li>
        <li>
          I hope to one day progam my own game whether it just be a simple
          browser game, or a fully fledged pc game.
        </li>
